# CodeScreen

A real-time collaborative coding interview platform with live Monaco editing, question bank, analytics, and session replay — plus a shared document editor built on the same Yjs collaboration stack.

---

## About

**CodeScreen** helps interviewers run live technical interviews and lets candidates code together in real time. Interviewers can create rooms from a built-in question bank or custom problems, invite candidates with a shareable code, run code and tests, review analytics, and replay sessions afterward.

The project also includes a **collaborative document editor** where multiple users can edit rich-text documents with live cursors, role-based access, and MongoDB-backed persistence.

Both experiences share authentication, WebSocket infrastructure, and Yjs CRDT sync for conflict-free multi-user editing.

## Features

### Interview platform

- **Live coding rooms** — Monaco editor with JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++
- **Real-time collaboration** — Yjs + y-monaco sync with live cursors (name + role color)
- **Offline resilience** — IndexedDB caching and automatic merge on reconnect
- **Question bank** — 16 built-in LeetCode-style problems plus custom questions (create, edit, filter, use in interviews)
- **Room creation** — Pick from the question bank or write a custom problem with test cases and starter code
- **Code execution** — Run code and hidden/visible test cases via backend execution service
- **In-room chat** — Real-time messaging between interviewer and candidate
- **Anti-cheat signals** — Tab/window focus monitoring for candidates
- **Interview analytics** — Duration, run timeline, integrity signals, final score, and notes
- **Session replay** — Scrub through recorded code snapshots and chat history
- **Role-based dashboard** — Separate Interviewer and Candidate views for past sessions
- **Invite flow** — Copy invite code from the room; candidates join via code or link

### Collaborative documents

- **Rich-text editing** — Tiptap editor with Markdown support
- **Live cursors** — See collaborators’ presence and cursor positions in real time
- **Access control** — Owner, editor, and viewer roles with email-based sharing
- **Version history** — Snapshots and restore for document content
- **MongoDB persistence** — Yjs state stored so content survives restarts
